# Python Project Structure
This repository is part of my post: [Python Project Structure](https://carlosgrande.me/my-pythons-project-cheatsheet/), where I explain my favorite way to organize and structure Python projects. The repository works as a template with all the folders and basic python files organized already.

You can see the cheatsheet here:
